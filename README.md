# Hi, I'm Sharonda Obamwonyi — Welcome to My GitHub!

## About Me

I'm an early career IT professional with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and continuous growth. My background includes nearly a decade in customer-focused roles, including my time as a flight attendant with Spirit Airlines, where I thrived in high-pressure environments, adapted quickly to changing circumstances, and discovered a love for working on the move.

Now, I’m transitioning into the tech space with a strong foundation in:

- **CompTIA A+ certification** 
- **Python programming (PCEP certified)**
- **Customer service (CBP certified)**
- **Hands-on experience with Power BI, Microsoft 365, and end-user support**

I’ve recently completed my coursework through Focus: HOPE’s IT Pathway program and hold an Associate of Arts & Science degree from Macomb Community College. I'm actively building realworld projects in Python, data analysis, and systems support to sharpen my skills and demonstrate my capabilities.

## What I'm Learning

- Python (automation, scripting, web apps)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic front-end)
- Flask and APIs
- SQL and database integration
- Version control with Git/GitHub
- Data analysis with Power BI
- Cloud computing fundamentals

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking opportunities in **technical support**, **software QA**, **data operations**, or **entry-level development** where I can contribute meaningfully, grow professionally, and ideally engage in **travel based assignments or flexible/remote projects**. My goal is to align with an innovative, mission-driven organization in the tech space that values agility, learning, and diverse experience.

I bring a customer-first mindset, strong communication skills, and a calm, reliable presence to every role whether it's 30,000 feet in the air or deep in code.
